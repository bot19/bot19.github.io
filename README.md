# Lion x Life blog

I made this blog while travelling to write about all the amazing experiences and ideas I had. Unfortunately I was having so much fun IRL and too obsessed with writing perfection that it sadly sat empty; like a newly built extravagant theater that never even saw a single soul...

Well, not to end on a sad note, the version 2 of this website does exist out there and even has some writing on it, with more to come! Better late than never..?

## 🏁 Features/objectives

1. Make a simple blog that would reflect me in visuals and word
2. Use & learn a static website generator
3. Execute some cool concepts!

## 🖥️ Tech

1. Hexo `v3.2`
2. Embedded JavaScript templates (ejs)
3. sass/scss with [Bulma CSS](https://bulma.io/)

## 🚀 How to run

RIP. I couldn't get this to run, it's from 2/2018 and hasn't been updated since. Probably why I re-created it.

## 📝 Notes

Currently lives at [bot19.github.io](https://bot19.github.io/) but who knows for how much longer, probably to the end of 2024.
